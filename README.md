## ‚ú® Project Overview

**Food Lover** is a **fully responsive and professional landing page** designed for restaurants, coffee shops, or food-themed blogs. The project's primary goal is to provide a clean, modern, and fast-loading user interface (UI) with a focus on an excellent user experience across all devices.

This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in:
1.  **Flexibility:** Key variables (like main colors) can be easily modified via the `style.css` file.
2.  **Responsiveness:** The design adapts seamlessly to mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens using modern CSS techniques.

## üíª Technology Stack Analysis

This project is an excellent example of using **HTML5** and **Pure CSS3** to build an appealing and highly functional user interface.

### Core Technologies:

| Technology | Role in the Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Provides the **semantic structure** of the page (Header, Sections, Footer, etc.). |
| **CSS3** | Handles all **visual styling**, including layout (Flexbox), colors, and animations. |
| **Font Awesome** | Used for modern, scalable **icons** (e.g., search, menu bar). |

### Key Code Functionality:

The code operates as a **Static Frontend**, with a strong focus on modularity and separation of concerns.

1.  **Component Separation (`index.html`):** The entire page is divided into distinct sections using the `<section>` tag for logical organization: `home`, `about`, `menu`, `products`, `review`, `contact`, and `blogs`.
2.  **CSS Variables (`style.css`):** The `:root` selector defines color variables (`--main-color`, `--black`, etc.)‚Äîa key professional feature that allows for **easy, single-point theme customization** of the entire site.
3.  **Layout Control (Flexbox):** The core layout of elements (like menu items within a `.box-container`) is controlled using **Flexbox**, ensuring items are aligned and distributed beautifully and responsibly.
4.  **Interactive Elements:** Features like the **Search Form** and the mobile **Navigation Menu** are toggled using CSS classes (e.g., `.active`), controlled by simple JavaScript (not shown in the provided code, but the CSS structure is ready for it), showcasing a clear separation between content and behavior.
